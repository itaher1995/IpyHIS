# IpyHIS
An Ipython Module that allows for a visual interface to the HIS API. This module is currently in its first iteration of development. 

## Objective of this Module
To allow hydrologic scientists that use CUAHSI's services to access information using a visual interface or by specific identifiers known as huc codes.

## Submodules
Map - A class that derives much of its functionality from the ipyleaflet module. However, it is NOT a subclass.
Site Search - A pool of functions that search sites based on identifiers known as huc codes. Can use huc 8, huc 10 and huc 12.
